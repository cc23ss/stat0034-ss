Repository for Sample Selection Methods/Code for STAT0034 Project.

Please download the code as a single file, then set the working directory in R to be that file. This is in order to load the correct bibliographies for each file.

NOTE: The bibliographies do follow the Harvard Style but are incomplete. I have left the references in the .rmd files for completeness, but for a comprehensive citation please look at my dissertation.
