# stat0034-ss
Repository for Sample Selection Methods/Code for STAT0034 Project.

Please download the code as a single folder, then set the working directory in R to be that file. This is in order to load the correct bibliographies for each file.

The following packages MUST be installed before use for the code to run:
- sampleSelection
- ssmodels
- ssmrob
- numDeriv
- mvtnorm

NOTES: 
1. The bibliographies do follow the Harvard Style but are incomplete. I have left the references in the .rmd files for completeness, but for a comprehensive citation please look at my dissertation. 
2. No author is provided for anonymity.
